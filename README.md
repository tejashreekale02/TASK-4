# TASK-4 - MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IMPLEMENTATION

COMPANY : CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME : Tejashree Kale 

INTERN ID : CT08LBJ

DOMAIN : Python Programming

BATCH DURATION : 10th January 2025 to 10th February 2025

MENTOR NAME : Neela Santosh Kumar

DSCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED : 1.Data Loading: The script loads a dataset from a URL. The dataset is assumed to have two columns: text (the email content) and label (whether the email is spam or ham).

2.Preprocessing: The labels are converted to binary values (1 for spam, 0 for ham). The text data is then converted into TF-IDF features using TfidfVectorizer.

3.Model Training: A Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB) is trained on the TF-IDF transformed training data.

4.Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

5.Saving the Model: The trained model and the TF-IDF vectorizer are saved to disk using joblib for future use.
